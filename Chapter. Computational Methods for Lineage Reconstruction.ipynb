    "The recent development of genetic lineage recorders, designed to register the genealogical history of cells using induced somatic mutations, has opened the possibility of reconstructing complete animal cell lineages. In order to reconstruct a cell lineage tree from a molecular recorder, it is crucial to use an appropriate reconstruction algorithm. \n",
    "Current approaches include algorithms specifically designed for cell lineage reconstruction and the repurposing of phylogenetic algorithms. These methods have, however, the same objective: to uncover the hierarchical relationships between cells and the sequence of cell divisions that have occurred during development. \n",
    "In this chapter, I will use the phylogenetic software FastTree to reconstruct a lineage tree, in a step-by-step manner, using data from a simulated CRISPR-Cas9 recorder. To ensure reproducibility,the code is presented as a Jupyter notebook, available (together with the necessary input files) at https://github.com/irepansalvador/lineage_reconstruction_chapter ."

    "In recent years, the development and utilization of genetic lineage recorders have offered a new perspective on studying cell lineages. One of the game-changing tools in this field is CRISPR-based molecular technology. By harnessing the power of CRISPR-Cas9, scientists can introduce targeted genetic modifications into cells, allowing the recording of their lineage relationships through mutations accumulated over time.\n",
    "The process involves the insertion of a synthetic construct into the genetic material of cells, which can accumulate stochastic mutations upon the induction of CRISPR-Cas9 activity during cell differentiation. These mutations serve as a molecular archive, akin to DNA barcodes, which can be read and deciphered through sequencing techniques. By analyzing the patterns of mutations, researchers can reconstruct the cell lineage, shedding light on the developmental paths taken by individual cells.\n",

    "The explosion of lineage tracing technologies has also highlighted the importance of using appropriate lineage reconstruction methods.\n",
    "In some cases, researchers have tailored algorithms specifically designed for cell lineage reconstruction [1, 2], while others have applied phylogenetic reconstruction algorithms to reconstruct cell lineages [3,4].\n",
    "A recent benchmarking effort conducted via a crowdsourcing innitiative by the DREAM Challenge [5] encouraged participants from diverse fields to submit lineage reconstruction algorithms to reconstruct lineages from different nature and sizes. \n",
    "The best performers from this bechmarking study included a distance-based method (\"DCLEAR\", [1]) and a Machine learning algorithm (\"AMberRland\", [2]). Interestingly, the widely used phylogenetic reconstruction algorithm FastTree [6] (used as a reference algorithm in the study) performed very well, suggesting it is a reliable and effective tool for cell lineage reconstruction."

    "In this chapter, I will use FastTree to reconstruct a cell lineage as I consider it has several advantages that make it a suitable choice for cell lineage reconstruction. \n",
    "Firstly, its speed and efficiency are noteworthy. With the increasing amount of data generated by lineage tracing technologies, it is crucial to have a reconstruction method that can handle large datasets in a reasonable amount of time. In this sense, FastTree's ability to reconstruct phylogenetic trees from thousands or even millions of sequences quickly and accurately makes it a good candidate.\n",
    "Additionally, FastTree uses an approximately maximum-likelihood method, a robust and reliable approach for reconstructing phylogenetic trees. Lastly, an important practical advantage is its ease of installation and use, making it accesible to a wide range of researchers with varying levels of computational expertise."

The initial cell then undergoes $d=5$ cell divisions, growing into a population of $N=32$ cells ($N = 2^d$). Following each cell division, each unmutated target can mutate (with a probability $\\mu_d = 0.05$) to one of several possible mutated states. Once a target is mutated, it can no longer change, either to revert to the unmutated state or to transit to a new state.\n",

As in our example we are using a simulated tree, we have this possibility. A simple metric that can be used to compare two phylogenetic trees is the Robinson–Foulds distance. In here we will use a scaled implementation of the RF distance, so the RF distance can have minimum value of 0 (of the reconstructed tree is identical to the reference tree) and a maximum value of 1 if none of the bifurcations of the reference tree is found in the reconstructed tree). This provides a measure of the global accuracy of the inferred lineage tree. \n",

It is therefore recommended that researchers consider choosing an appropriate reconstruction method based on the features (size, depth, number of targets) of the lineage tree they want to reconstruct."
